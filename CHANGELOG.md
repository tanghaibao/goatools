### Support traversing optional relationships

Support traversing optional relationships, like *part_of* and *regulates*,
when doing propagating counts using these two new arguments in `scripts/find_enrichment.py`:

```bash
        -r, --relationship    Propagate counts up all relationships (default: False)
       --relationships        [RELATIONSHIPS [RELATIONSHIPS ...]]
                               Propagate counts up user-specified relationships
                               (default: None)
```

### Added support for specifying specific evidence codes

* Specify evidence codes, like EXP (Inferred from Experiment), to exclude or include in a GOEA.
* Specify evidence classes, like Experimental (EXP IDA IPI IMP IGI IEP), which include many evidence codes.
* Get evidence code help:

```bash
python3 scripts/find_enrichment.py --ev_help
python3 scripts/find_enrichment.py --ev_help_short
```

[#119](https://github.com/tanghaibao/goatools/issues/119)

### Added splitting GOEA into BP, MF, and CC

Split GOEA into three separate analyses by default:

* BP (biological process)
* MF (molecular function)
* CC (cellular component)
